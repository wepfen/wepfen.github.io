    <p>Here experience and review of the PIPA certification.</p>
<h1 id="context">Context</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently student in cybersecurity implying that I&rsquo;m supposed to learn things, but, i end up not having too much spare time to dedicate in messing around with IoT hacking.</p>
<p>Then, my friend which was at the same time focused on another TCM security certification told me about the &ldquo;PJIT&rdquo; (now PIPA) which seemed to be great to learn fundamentals of hardware hacking, electronics and IoT security while being useful professionally thanks to the skills assessment, so i decided to give it a try.</p>
<h1 id="course-material">Course material</h1>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>For the <a href="https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/beginner-s-guide-to-iot-and-hardware-hacking">course</a>, our instructor is <a href="https://www.andrewbellini.com/">Andrew Bellini</a>, a hardware hacker with a background in electrical engineering.</p>
<p>So during the course there is a large part of electrical engineering. And as a person who never got into that before, it was pretty easy to understand and it helped me a lot to figure out how things work under the hood. Moreover, every new concept introduced was here for a reason and well explained so even an electrical engineering unaware person knows where we are going.</p>
<p>Through the course we learn by doing hands-on exercises on a TP-link router (TL-WR841N model). In shorts we learn to understand a <strong>pcb</strong> and identify its components, use fundamental hardware hacking tools like a <strong>logical analyser</strong>, <strong>multimeter</strong>, <strong>soldering station</strong> and more. Connect to a serial port using <strong>UART</strong>, doing recon on IoT device components, reading datasheets, <strong>extracting a firmware</strong>, hunt for interesting data, doing <strong>reverse engineering on binaries</strong> and more.</p>
<p>Also, during the course I wasn&rsquo;t really comfortable with reverse engineering and Ghidra but it helps to try some easy challenges on CTF platforms like <a href="https://www.root-me.org/fr/Challenges/Cracking/">RootMe</a> or <a href="https://hackropole.fr/fr/reverse/">Hackropole</a> to get comfortable with it.</p>
<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>
<p>The PIPA is at an affordable price (<strong>200$</strong> for students) and come packaged with the <a href="https://academy.tcm-sec.com/courses/enrolled/2138967">IoT and hardware hacking course</a> from the TCM academy platform and two exam attempts.</p>
<p>And of course you keep the course for life (hi INE).</p>
<p>Also I should mention the cost of the equipment that went up to an additionnal 100$ (because I was greedy). But you can easily buy everything you need for 50$ or less if you buy from banggood or aliexpress and reading this <a href="https://tcm-sec.com/getting-started-with-iot-hardware-hacking/">post</a>.</p>
<p>But it is still possible to follow the course without <strong>any</strong> material (even the router) as the instructor will show every steps. However, without hands-on experience it&rsquo;s just like reading the solution without even trying to solve the problem, so the fun is gone and it&rsquo;s more likely to immediately forget everything.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/pipa/pipa_first.png" alt="Pipa first"></p>
<h1 id="the-exam">The exam</h1>
<p>The exam lasts 4 days. 2 days to review a firmware like in a real pentest and two days to write a report.</p>
<p>The whole exam is hosted in a virtual environment with all the tools needed to perform the review and there are no physical device to test.</p>
<p>You can learn more about it in this <a href="https://tcm-sec.com/pass-pipa-certification-exam/">post</a> which tell <strong>everything</strong> you need to know about the exam.</p>
<h2 id="getting-crushed-by-the-exam">Getting crushed by the exam</h2>
<p>During the exam, I could directly use what i&rsquo;ve learnt on the course and quickly identify several vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>If you follow the course carefully there should be not any problem to assess the device.</p>
<p>Also I recommand these blogpost from TCM security :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tcm-sec.com/hardware-hacking-part-3-analyzing-firmware/">Analyzing and Enumerating Firmware</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tcm-sec.com/reverse-engineering-and-exploiting-binaries/">Reverse Engineering and Exploiting Binaries</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BUT</strong>,</p>
<p>I ended up <strong>failing my first attempt</strong> because my report wasn&rsquo;t detailed and professional at all. I wasn&rsquo;t really familiar with this game and approached the report like it was a CTF writeup. Honestly, I needed this to get back to reality.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/posts/pipa/green-lantern-misses-report.gif" alt="how i be missing my report"></p>
<p>Then, I took a large breath, read <strong>carefully</strong> the <a href="https://tcm-sec.com/pass-pipa-certification-exam/">How to Pass the PIPA Certification Exam</a> post, and retried it.</p>
<h2 id="crushing-the-exam">Crushing the exam</h2>
<p>I got back to it, and as I already got several vulnerabilities, on this second attempt I mainly focused on the report.</p>
<p>By the way I used many parts from the <a href="https://github.com/hmaverickadams/TCM-Security-Sample-Pentest-Report">TCM security pentest report sample</a> to write mine.</p>
<p>Finally, I successfully passed.</p>
<h1 id="my-thoughts">My thoughts</h1>
<p>I really liked the course and the exam, I can say that it suits any person interested in hardware and IoT hacking but not knowing where to start.</p>
<p>Also the exam is useful because it simulates a professional environment to introduce us to real-world cases.</p>

<br>
<h1 id="whats-next-">What&rsquo;s next ?</h1>
<p>I liked this course and want to know more, what I plan is :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dig more into other protocols like BLE, RFID, MQTT, zigbee and also learn about RF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Order a device from Amazon or Aliexpress and try to do some.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn about binary exploitation and train on labs like <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/damn-vulnerable-arm-router-dvar-tinysploitarm,224/">DVAR</a> or <a href="https://azeria-labs.com/lab-vm-2-0/">ARM Lab vm 2.0</a>.</p>
